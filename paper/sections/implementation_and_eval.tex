\section{Implementation \& Evaluation} \label{sec:implementation_and_eval}
\alberto{Ideally we would describe here (i) our implementation of the store, (ii), our implementation of the store as an Ethereum contract, (iii) our implementation of the store as a Sui Move contract. @Philipp, point (ii) is actually a cool MSc project.}

\alberto{Add here (i) micro-bench of our crypto functions, (ii) L graph of our store, (iii) L-graph of our store under faults, (iv) scalability graph of our store, (v) price and tx-size of Ethereum contract, (vi) price and tx-size of Sui-Move contract.}
